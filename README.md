# myOwnBlog
This is my own webside about my photography ðŸ˜€(*^_^*)ðŸ˜€.


# top priority
- âœ” imageSlider.
- âœ” Reduce image loading time for image-slideshow (resize the img from the server instead of in user's browser)
- âœ” Image navbar.
- Fix the different result in different user's device (mostly are resizing problem).
- responsive picture gallery in the index.html.
- Sidebar menu (tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0O4pY2xX10).
- Background with some random figures using JS.

# minor priority
- âœ” main title -> animation.
- menu button -> hover animation.
- menu button -> dropdown.
- âœ” image-slideshow-navbar lined in a wave-shape.
- âœ” click the image-slideshow-navbar will show the placeName instead of the picture.
- âœ” box-shadow for the image-slideshow-navbar.

# Ideas
- âœ” might put the main navBar to the left side and fold, only expand when you click a menu button.
- load the thumbnail of the image first.
- Some music maybe?
