- BGM.
- ✔ imageSlider.
- ✔ Reduce image loading time for image-slideshow (resize the img from the server instead of in user's browser)
- ✔ Image navbar.
- responsive picture gallery in the index.html.
- Sidebar menu (tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0O4pY2xX10).

# minor priority
- ✔ main title -> animation.

-load the thumbnail of the image first.
