# myOwnBlog
This is my own webside about my photography ðŸ˜€(*^_^*)ðŸ˜€.


# top priority
- âœ” Image-slideshow.
- âœ” Reduce image loading time for image-slideshow (resize the img from the server instead of in user's browser)
- âœ” Image navbar.
- âœ” Image-slideshow description and animation.
- âœ” Picture Seires (Galleries).
- âœ” Parallax scrolling.
- Parallax scrolling for each section.
- responsive picture gallery.

# minor priority
- âœ” main title -> animation.
- âœ” image-slideshow-navbar lined in a wave-shape.
- âœ” click the image-slideshow-navbar will show the placeName instead of the picture.
- âœ” box-shadow for the image-slideshow-navbar.
- Shrink the size of the image-slideshow-navbar by 50px by 50px (might not)?
- Like button next to every picture seires.
- "Smooth navbar".

# bugs
- Auto fit the mobile phone users.
- âœ” Swiper-slide each slide has different width (by setting CSS as -> width: auto !important;) , but swiper.js still treats all the slides as the same width, as a result, the swiper.js won't scroll the slides properly.
  - fixed: by setting main.js as -> loop: true. It not technically fixing the problem, but it works magically. :)
- view collections warpper is too big.
- âœ” Letterspace for each navbar's item has issue
  - fixed: I just simply delete letter-spacing part...

# Ideas
- âœ” might put the main navBar to the left side and fold, only expand when you click a menu button.
- Chinese version.
- load the thumbnail of the image first.
- Some music maybe?
- Background with some random figures using JS? (1%)
