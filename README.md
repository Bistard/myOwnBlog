# myOwnBlog
This is my own blog about my photography.


# top priority
1. BGM.
2. ✔ image-slideshows.
3. ✔ Reduce image loading time for image-slideshow (resize the img from the server NOT in user's browser)
4. responsive picture gallery.

# minor priority
1. imageSlider nav bar turns white when active.
2. ✔ main title -> animation.
3. menu button -> animation.
4. load the thumbnail of the image first.
5. ✔ ImageSlider play automatically.

# Ideas
1. ✔ might put the main navBar to the left side and fold, only expand when you click a menu button.
